Spark is a super-hot topic these days. It was conceived in Berkeley, California in 2009
by Matei Zaharia initially as an attempt to prove the Mesos execution platform feasible
and was open sourced in 2010. In 2013, it was donated to the Apache Software Foundation,
and it has been the target of lightning-fast development ever since. In 2015,
Spark was one of the most active Apache projects and had more than 1000 contributors.
Today, it is a part of all major Hadoop distributions and is used by many organizations,
large and small, throughout the world in all kinds of applications.
